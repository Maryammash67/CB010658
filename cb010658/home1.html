  <img src="enjo.png">
  
  <p class="para">Sri Lanka is a tiny island nation that is home to six remarkable UNESCO-protected cultural heritage monuments despite being one of the smallest countries in the Asia Pacific Region.
    Sri Lanka is one of the finest places in Asia to observe elephants, leopards, whales, and birds, with an abundance of elephants, leopards, whales, and birds.
    It's worth noting that the European Tourism Association had named Bentota "the World's Most Beautiful Beach." If you enjoy the beach, you will enjoy this nation.
    <br>
   
    Ceylon black tea is regarded as one of the greatest in the world. Tea is grown in a variety of locations around the country. Uva, Nuwara Eliya, and Kandy produce some of the most popular Ceylon teas, each with its own distinct flavor. Spending a day in Nuwara Eliya or Kandy, which have pleasant breezes and gorgeous mountain vistas, with a fine cup of Ceylon tea may be a peaceful experience.
    Sri Lankans are extremely warm and inviting. You will be greeted by pleasant faces wherever you go. We were hailed by people on the street many times during our tour. We were very moved by their kindness.

    <p class="para">Its ancient history and Buddhist background have largely affected it. The country has a long and 
      illustrious artistic legacy that includes music, dance, and visual arts. Cuisine, festivals, and sports all represent
       the Sri Lankan way of life. South Indian influences can be seen in a variety of ways.<br><br>
      From ancient times, Sri Lanka has had relations to the Indian subcontinent. Sinhalese account for 74.8 percent of the
       population, Sri Lankan Moors 9.23 percent, Indian Tamil 4.16 percent, Sri Lankan Tamil 11.21 percent, and Other 0.6 
       percent. Due to ancient historic texts such as the Mahawansa, Sri Lanka has a recorded history of over 2000 years.
        Sri Lankan culture has been altered by centuries of sporadic foreign influence to its current state. Nonetheless,
         the island's primarily traditional Sinhalese people,
       as well as other minorities that make up the Sri Lankan identity, celebrate historical customs and festivals.

      <img src="srilanka.jpg" >
      <p class="para3">Sri Lankan culture has been impacted by a variety of forces, yet it has managed to maintain many of 
        its old characteristics. Its ancient history and Buddhist background have largely affected it. The country has a long
         and illustrious artistic legacy that includes music, dance, and visual arts. Cuisine, festivals, and sports all 
         represent the Sri Lankan way of life. South Indian influences can be seen in a variety of ways. The Portuguese, 
         the Dutch, and the British all had a hand in colonizing the area. Cricket, cuisine, holistic health, religious icons 
         like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports like tea, cinnamon, and diamonds are all well-known in Sri Lankan 
         culture. The culture of Sri Lanka is varied, as it differs from area to region.
